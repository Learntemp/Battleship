// As a user I can see a 10 x 10 grid so that I can see the gameboard.

// As a user when I click on a position, the position changes color so that I can tell that a position has been torpedoed.

// As a user I can see how many torpedoes I have used, so that I can keep track of how many I have used.

// As a user once a position has been torpedoed, it cannot be torpedoed again so that I don't waste torpedoes.
